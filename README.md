(This is a preliminary version of my site. I'm working on improvements :)

I am a:
- Spanish language expert 🇪🇸
- with highly developed English skills 🇬🇧 🗣
- I have a masters in applied linguistics from Universidad Antonio de Nebrija (2013) 🎓
- and 10 years of experience translating, teaching and helping tech companies with their professional communications 👨‍🏫

I am currently focusing on developing my career as a professional ENG/SPAN translator who specializes on IT projects 🖥

Are you a translator recruiter? I'd love to hear from you. Here's my Proz profile.

Are you a student looking for Spanish lessons? Send me an email at yotzin@gmail.com and we can talk.
